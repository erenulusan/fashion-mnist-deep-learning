**Binary and Multiclass Classification on Fashion MNIST using Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and CNNs.**

## Project Description
In this project, I aimed to improve my skills in deep learning and classification by working on the Fashion MNIST dataset.  
I first performed binary classification (labels 0 and 1), then extended the work to all 10 labels for multiclass classification.

## Notebooks

- **Fashion MNIST (0 vs 1):**  
  Manual Logistic Regression, Sklearn Logistic Regression, 2-Layer Neural Network, and L-Layer Neural Network.

- **Fashion MNIST (Multiclass):**  
  2-Layer Neural Network, L-Layer Neural Network, CNN, and CNN with Hyperparameter Tuning using Keras Tuner.

## Dataset
This project uses the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) available on Kaggle.  
The dataset is not uploaded to this repository to keep it lightweight.
